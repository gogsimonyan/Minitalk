## Project Information
The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.

## Mandatory

- Produce server & client executables
- client must send a string passed as a parameter to server (referenced by its process ID) which then displays it
- Use SIGUSR1 & SIGUSR2 signals ONLY

## Guide

UNIX SIGNAL <br /> 
UNIX Signals allows to communicate proccesses to each other. There are many types of signals, you can see all signals using ```kill -l``` command. <br />
The SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals are set aside for you to use any way you want, default action is to terminate the process.<br />
We can handle signals using Signal or Sigaction.<br />
Signal cann't block signals, has different behaviour in different systems and has undefined behaviour in multiproccessing systems. <br />
Sigaction can block signals, behaviour doesn't depend on system.<br />
For using sigaction, we must use sigaction struct.<br />
```sh
struct sigaction _structName_;
_structName_.sa_flags = SA_SIGINFO;
_structName_.sa_sigaction = your_handler_function;
sigaction(SIGUSR1, &_structName_, NULL);
```
sa_flags = SA_SIGINFO â€” queue this signal. The default is not to queue a signal delivered to a process. If a signal isn't queued, and the same signal is set multiple times on a process or thread before it runs, only the last signal is delivered. If you set the SA_SIGINFO flag, the signals are queued, and they're all delivered.<br />
sa_sigaction - The address of a signal handler or action for queued signals.<br />
sigaction(int sig, const struct sigaction * act, struct sigaction * oact );<br />
sig - The signal number (SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 )<br />
act - NULL, or a pointer to a sigaction structure that specifies how you want to modify the action for the given signal.<br />
oact - NULL, or a pointer to a sigaction structure that the function fills with information about the current action for the signal.<br />

For sending characters, convert character to bites and send bits using ```kill(pid, _signal_)``` function.<br />
```sh
kill(pid, SIGUSR1);
```
pid is proccess id, which is unique.<br />
For example when bit is 1 send SIGUSR1, and when bit is 0 send SIGUSR2.<br />

## Compilation

Clone repo and compile files into server & client executables via make.
```sh
$ ./server
PID: <PID_SERVER>

(wait)
```

```sh
$ ./client <PID_SERVER> <STRING>
```
